# Progressive CLI Lesson Template Prompt

Use this prompt to create step-by-step, building CLI lessons that teach concepts incrementally.

## Core Prompt Template

```
Create a progressive, step-by-step lesson for [LESSON_TOPIC] that builds from absolute basics to a complete working example.

Structure the lesson exactly like this:

## Lesson X: [LESSON_TITLE]

Learn [brief description] step by step, starting from the absolute basics.

## Prerequisites
- [list minimal prerequisites]

## Step 1: [Fundamental Concept]
Start with the most basic concept. Explain what it is and why it matters.
Create a minimal example (3-5 lines) that demonstrates just this one thing.
Include specific commands to test it.

## Step 2: [Build on Step 1]
Take the concept from Step 1 and add one new element.
Show the code evolution clearly.
Include test commands.

## Step 3: [Add Next Concept]
Continue building incrementally.
Each step should be a logical progression from the previous.

[Continue with Steps 4-12, each building on the previous]

## Step [N]: Combining Everything
Create a complete, practical CLI that uses all concepts learned.
This should be a useful tool, not just a demo.

## üéØ Challenge: [Practical Challenge]
Give a specific challenge that requires using all learned concepts.
Provide:
- Clear requirements (numbered list)
- Getting started hints
- Example usage
- Success criteria/test

## What You've Learned
Summarize key takeaways with checkboxes.

## Next Steps
Briefly preview what comes next.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Each step must build directly on the previous step
2. No step should jump ahead or introduce multiple new concepts
3. Every code example must be complete and runnable
4. Include specific test commands after each example
5. Progress from "hello world" level to practical tool
6. Each step should be 1-3 concepts maximum
7. Always include error cases and validation as you progress
8. Use Bun.js and TypeScript
9. Make each example immediately testable
10. The final combined example should be genuinely useful
```

## Example Usage

For Phase 3 (Argument Parsing):
```
Create a progressive, step-by-step lesson for "Professional Argument Parsing with Commander.js" that builds from absolute basics to a complete working example.

[Apply the template above, focusing on]:
- Step 1: Installing and importing commander
- Step 2: Basic command definition
- Step 3: Adding options
- Step 4: Subcommands
- etc.
```

## Customization Variables

Replace these in the template for each lesson:

- `[LESSON_TOPIC]`: "Professional Argument Parsing with Commander.js"
- `[LESSON_TITLE]`: "Advanced CLI Arguments" 
- `[brief description]`: "how to build professional CLIs with sophisticated argument parsing"
- Prerequisites: Adjust based on previous lessons
- Step topics: Customize the progression for your specific topic
- Challenge: Create a relevant practical challenge
- Next Steps: Reference the actual next phase

## Key Success Patterns

1. **Micro-progressions**: Each step introduces only 1-2 new concepts
2. **Immediate testing**: Every example can be run and tested right away
3. **Practical evolution**: Examples evolve toward real-world utility
4. **Clear prerequisites**: Build on previous lessons explicitly
5. **Hands-on challenge**: End with something students build themselves

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Jumping to complex examples too early
‚ùå Introducing multiple concepts in one step
‚ùå Examples that can't be tested immediately
‚ùå Theoretical explanations without code
‚ùå Challenges that are too vague or too complex
‚ùå Steps that don't clearly build on previous steps
